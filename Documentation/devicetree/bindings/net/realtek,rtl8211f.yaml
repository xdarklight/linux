  The Realtek RTL8211F-CG/RTL8211FI-CG is a highly integrated Ethernet
  transceiver that is compatible with 10Base-T, 100Base-TX, and 1000Base-T
  IEEE 802.3 standards. It provides all the necessary physical layer
  functions to transmit and receive Ethernet packets over CAT.5 UTP cable.
  The RTL8211FI-CG is manufactured to industrial grade standards.

  The RTL8211F(I)-CG uses state-of-the-art DSP technology and an Analog
  Front End (AFE) to enable high-speed data transmission and reception over
  UTP cable. Functions such as Crossover Detection & Auto-Correction,
  polarity correction, adaptive equalization, cross-talk cancellation,
  echo cancellation, timing recovery, and error correction are implemented
  in the RTL8211F(I)-CG to provide robust transmission and reception
  capabilities at 10Mbps, 100Mbps, or 1000Mbps.

  Data transfer between MAC and PHY is via the Reduced Gigabit Media
  Independent Interface (RGMII) for 1000Base-T, 10Base-T, and 100Base-TX.
  The RTL8211F(I)-CG supports various RGMII signaling voltages, including
  3.3V, 2.5V, 1.8V, and 1.5V.

  The RTL8211F(I)-CG incorporates a state-of-the-art switching regulator that
  requires a well-designed PCB layout in order to achieve good power efficiency
  and lower the output voltage ripple and input overshoot.
